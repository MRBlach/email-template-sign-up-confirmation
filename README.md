<h1 id="cssInliner">CSS Inliner</h1>

Not all email clients are created equally. Some are unpredictable when it comes to CSS support and will strip styles that are not inlined. It is important to inline your CSS and then test the email before finalizing. There are various options for doing so. For example:

To verify that the CSS is inlined properly, use this [Responsive Email CSS Inliner](https://htmlemail.io/inline/) to copy and paste the source code.

To test the email before finalizing, use the [Litmus Email Tester](https://putsmail.com/) to send yourself the email first.
